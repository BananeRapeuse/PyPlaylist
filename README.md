 A Python program to listen musics downloaded from internet and make playlists (only for windows due to mpv)

 # Requirements
 1. 1st of all, you **absolutly** need to install [python](https://www.python.org)
 2. Then, to install all the requirements, just download [install_req.bat](https://github.com/bananerapeuse/pyplaylist/main/install_req.bat) and launch it

 # How to install 
 1. Download the latest [released](https://github.com/BananeRapeuse/PyPlaylist/releases) setup (please choose the setup for the language you want (FR/EN))
 2. Open the setup and install in the default path 
```
C:\Program Files x86\PyPlaylist
```
because if you install it in an other path it will don't work
 3. Once the installation went finished you will be able to launch the software from your homescreen

# How it works
- Programming language
The programming language is Python <🐍> ! I've choose it because it's easy to use not like C++ lol
- Music player
The software used for playing musics is [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), it's not too heavy and usable with Python to do cool things, it's also compatible with a lot of song formats
- Discord activity
To set your discord activity as "Playing PyPlaylist" and have informations in real-time of what's the music you're listening, I use [pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence) to interact with the Discord API.
