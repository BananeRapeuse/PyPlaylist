# PyPlaylist
 A Python program to listen musics downloaded from internet and make playlists (only for windows due to mpv)

 # Requirements
 1. 1st of all, you absolutly need to install [python](https://www.python.org)
 2. Then, to install all the requirements, just download "install_req.bat" and launch it as admin

 # How to install 
 1. Download the latest [released](https://github.com/BananeRapeuse/PyPlaylist/releases) setup (please choose the setup for the language you want (FR/EN))
 2. Open the setup and install in the default path (C:\Program Files x86\PyPlaylist) because if you install it in an other path it will don't work
 3. Once the installation went finished you will be able to launch the software from your homescreen

# How it works
- Programming language
The programming language is Pyton ! I've choose it because it's easy to use not like C++ :/
- Music player
The software used for playing musics is [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), it's not too heavy and usable with Python to do cool things, it's also compatible with a lot of music formats
- Discord activity
For seting your discord activity as "Playing PyPlaylist" and have informations in real-time of what's the music you're listening, I use [pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence) to interact with the Discord API.
